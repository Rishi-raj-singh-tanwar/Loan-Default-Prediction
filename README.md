# Loan-Default-Prediction
Classification project to predict loan default probability using borrower credit data and machine learning models.
# Credit Risk Loan Default Prediction

This project builds a classification model to predict **loan default risk** using real-world credit loan data (Kaggle). The goal is to estimate the **Probability of Default (PD)** based on borrower features such as income, loan amount, credit history, and employment type.

## Objectives

- Predict whether a loan applicant will default
- Explore borrower characteristics linked to credit risk
- Compare classification model performance

## Tools & Techniques

- **Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
- **Models Used**:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
  - Gradient Boosting

## Machine Learning Workflow

1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature Engineering
4. Model Building & Evaluation (Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, ROC-AUC)
5. Business interpretation of key risk drivers

## Outcome

The best-performing model accurately predicts loan default based on credit history, income stability, and other features. This solution can be used by financial institutions for better credit risk assessment.
